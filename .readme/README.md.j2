_"Τὰ πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" — Heraclitus_

**{{ package.description[:-1] }} in Rust.**
This package is part of [Flows.rs], a growing shrink-wrap inventory of
standard, reusable dataflow blocks for common use cases.

> [!TIP]
> 🚧 _We are building in public. This is presently under heavy construction._

## ✨ Features

- Provides components for [flow-based programming] (FBP) based on [Tokio].
- Enables dataflow systems through reusable components called blocks.
- Built on the dataflow primitives provided by the [Async-Flow] project.
- Supports opting out of any feature using comprehensive feature flags.
- Adheres to the Rust API Guidelines in its [naming conventions].
- Cuts red tape: 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.

### Glossary

- **System**: A collection of blocks that are connected together.
  Systems are the top-level entities in dataflow programs.

- **Block**: An encapsulated system component that processes messages.
  Blocks are the autonomous units of computation in a system.

- **Port**: A named connection point on a block that sends or receives
  messages. Ports are the only interfaces through which blocks communicate
  with each other.

- **Message**: A unit of data that flows between blocks in a system, from port
  to port. Any Rust type that implements the `Send + Sync + 'static` traits can
  be used as a message.

git clone https://github.com/artob/flows.rs.git
