_"Τὰ πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" — Heraclitus_

**Building blocks for [flow-based programming] (FBP) in Rust.**
This collection of crates implements a growing shrink-wrap inventory of
standard dataflow blocks for common use cases.

> [!TIP]
> 🚧 _We are building in public. This is presently under heavy construction._

## ✨ Features

- Provides components for flow-based programming (FBP) based on [Tokio].
- Supports dataflow systems by providing reusable components called blocks.
- Built on the primitives provided by the [Async-Flow] project.
- Supports opting out of any feature using comprehensive feature flags.
- Adheres to the Rust API Guidelines in its [naming conventions].
- No licensing headaches: 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 1.85+ (2024 edition)

## ⬇️ Installation

### Installation via Cargo

```bash
cargo add flows
```

## 👉 Examples

### Importing the Library

```rust
use flows::{audio, hash, image, io, json, math, rand, text};
```

### Implementing Blocks

#### Implementing a `split_string` block

```rust
use flows::{Inputs, Outputs, Result};

/// A block that splits input strings based on a delimiter.
async fn split_string(delim: &str, mut ins: Inputs<String>, outs: Outputs<String>) -> Result {
    while let Some(input) = ins.recv().await? {
        for output in input.split(delim) {
            outs.send(output.into()).await?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Implementing an `add_ints` block

```rust
use flows::{Inputs, Outputs, Result};

/// A block that outputs the sums of input numbers.
async fn add_ints(mut lhs: Inputs<i64>, mut rhs: Inputs<i64>, sums: Outputs<i64>) -> Result {
    loop {
        let (a, b) = tokio::try_join!(lhs.recv(), rhs.recv())?;
        match (a, b) {
            (Some(a), Some(b)) => sums.send(a + b).await?,
            _ => break,
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
